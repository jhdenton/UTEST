UTEST is a Unit Testing and reporting platform written in C. It is intended for use in Low-Level testing, regression testing, and even Test-Driven Development (TDD).

It is primarily intended for embedded development, but as such, the porting functions can simply be setup for console operation as well.

The included example and the default utest_port.c file are for the Microchip dsPIC33FJ128GP804 processor in a custom target board with a 20MHz crystal and serial UART output.
